## [unreleased]

## [0.15.1] - 2026.03.17

### Added

- CI/CD for PyPI deployment
- Check for `gmx` version

### Changed

- Update documentation, tutorials and installation
- Improve code styling
- Use always 1 bar instead 1.01325 for membrane simulations during equilibration

### Fixed

- Better logging
- Move to new setuptools and update versioning
- Exclude `pme` flag during equilibration
- Pass `gmx` dependencies during solvation

### Removed

- MDP options from `bonded` and `coul` windows as there are not being used. Those flags are only relevant when either Lennard-Jones or Coulomb interaction are decoupled. In our case for `coul` they also irrelevant as the options are applied only if `sc-coul = yes`, which by default is `no`. Check the [GROMACS docs](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/user-guide/mdp-options.html#mdp-sc-coul) for more info on these MDP options.

```mdp
sc-alpha                 = 0.5
sc-power                 = 1
sc-sigma                 = 0.3
```

- `"MDRestraintsGenerator @ git+https://github.com/ale94mleon/MDRestraintsGenerator.git@dev"` dependency from `pyproject.toml` as it is not accepted by PyPi. This dependency is built during the conda environment step anyway.
