# ðŸš€ Tutorials

Get started quickly with **ready-to-simulate** examples provided in the [examples](https://github.com/ale94mleon/BindFlow/tree/main/examples) directory of the BindFlow repository. These examples are designed to work out of the box, giving you a hands-on introduction to BindFlow.

**Getting started tips**:

1. **Review the examples** - Browse through the example simulations to understand how they are structured.
2. **Adjust configurations** - Update the configuration files to match your cluster resources and environment. This ensures simulations run smoothly.
3. **Reference configuration files** - Several files are provided for illustration in the [config](https://github.com/ale94mleon/BindFlow/tree/main/examples/configs) directory. Use them as a guide to create or customize your own simulation setups.
4. **Run your simulations** - Once configured, execute the examples to see BindFlow in action. For deployment instructions, see the [Deploy guide](./guides/deploy.md).
5. **Troubleshooting** - Check common issues and solutions in the [FAQ](./faq.md). If your problem is not listed, or you have a feature request, feel free to open an issue on [BindFlow's issue tracker](https://github.com/ale94mleon/BindFlow/issues).

:class: info

The examples are a great way to get hands-on quickly, but theyâ€™re **not a replacement for the full documentation**. For a deeper understanding of BindFlow and its features, we encourage you to explore the documentation--we put a lot of love into it! ðŸ˜Š
